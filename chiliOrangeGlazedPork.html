                    <p>Glaze Ingredients
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup orange marmalade - I use polaner (fruit juice sweetened)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chili sauce *</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. vegetable oil (I use olive oil) </li>
        
        </ul>

            <ol>
            <li>mix glaze ingredients in a bowl and set aside </li>
            <li>season ribs with salt, pepper, granulated garlic and onion powder and place in a shallow baking pan with a little bit of water...loosely cover with foil and place in 250º oven for 1½ - 2 hours (the idea is to cook them very slowly..you want the meat to be fall off the bones tender) ...at that point check on it..if the fat is nice and soft and the meat wants to fall off the bones - toss the foil (cook uncovered from here on out) ..and brush with glaze every 10 minutes for the next half hour or so.. after a half hour, give them one more hit of glaze (by now it should be sticking to the meat pretty well) - now turn on the broiler and stick them back in..keep an eye on them...they're done when they look kinda bubbly and are starting to get that yummy char around the edges - YUM!
</li>
            <li>* I can't find a chili sauce that doesn't have high fructose corn syrup so I've taken to making my own chili sauce-like concoction - an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce and about a teaspoon of a roasted chili pepper puree I made with peppers from our garden (just roasted the peppers with a drizzle of olive oil (removed some of the seeds so it wouldn't kill me) then put the roasted peppers in the food processor and gave them a whirl) </li>
            <li>the original recipe is for country style pork ribs but I've also used this glaze on just regular boneless and semi-boneless chops... it would also be good on a pork tenderloin and I'm sure chicken too... just use like BBQ sauce - baste meat with glaze </li>
       
            </ol>
