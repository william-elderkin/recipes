            <li>1 teaspoon coarse ground pepper</li>
            <li>2 limes juiced + wedges for serving</li>
            <li>2 oranges juiced</li>
            <li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>

            <ol>
            <li>prepare the marinade (adobo): in a food processor, zap the first 7 ingredients (through orange juice) - drizzle in olive oil and pulse until you have a nice puree.</li>
            <li>with a sharp knife cut the fat away from the meat, leaving an edge attached and keeping it all in one piece.</li>
            <li>start at the wide end and go to the narrow end (you don't have to separate it completely - just leave enough still conected so that you can flip the fat over to the side while you season the meat itself..</li>
            <li>the fat will be placed over the seasoned meat and will cook over the meat giving it more flavor) season the side of the fat that goes over the meat with a bit of the marinade also - just that one side by running your hand on it. the other side (the top) should only have salt.</li>
            <li>make very deep slits all over the meat and rub the marinade into the meat making sure that it goes into all the slits. put the fat back over the meat to look the same as before it was cut and sprinkle it with salt.</li>
            <li> refrigerate the shoulder, covered with plastic wrap, for 24 hours (if you are short on time bake at this time)
let the meat get back into room temperature before cooking, if it was refrigerated. (about one hour). </li>
            <li>place the pork, fat side up, in a roasting pan fitted with a rack insert, and using a sharp knife, score the surface of the meat with small slits.</li>
            <li>place the meat in a deep pan with the fat side up. there will be a lot of grease so be sure to use a deep pan that is at least 2" deep. the fat side up will be nice and crunchy DO NOT cover with foil.</li>
            <li>preheat the oven and cook at 400ยบ for one hour, then reduce temperature to 300ยบ for about 4 hours or so (until thermometer reads 180ยบ ...the higher internal temp makes the meat easier to pull and more tender) - DO NOT TURN MEAT. when the meat is done prick it on the side with a fork to see if it shreds. If the skin is not crispy enough leave it in the oven and raise the temperature again to 400ยบ and cook another 15 or so until it is crispy. it will crisp fast so keep your eye on it!</li>
            <li>let the meat rest on a cutting board for 15 minutes before slicing, covered lightly with aluminum foil. before slicing, remove the crunchy yummy skin (cut that up separately and serve with the meat) drizzle meat with lime juice and garnish with cilantro </li>
            <li>* a fresh pork shoulder WITH the the skin can be kinda hard to find sometimes... plus that's WAY too much meat for the two of us (a 4 pound pork shoulder is enough to feed like 10 people!!) so I just use a small regular pork roast - good for a dinner and still have a decent amount of leftovers for a couple few lunches - or enough for 4-5 people for dinner =)</li>
            <li>the smaller roast takes a lot less time to cook as well - more like an hour... but if you can, you should try it the way it's written some time... the skin gets soooooooooooooooo delicious!! </li>
            <li>note: it will probably kill me one day but I pour the marinade off into a pot and let it simmer while the roast is in the oven - let it reduce a bit and it makes a (strong but yummy) sauce</li>
